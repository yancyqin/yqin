# Idea in my mind

Enabling open discussion on Bible verses on Bible.com website.

## Phase 1 (like stackoverflow)
 - Allowing registered user to ask `question` on a chapter or a verse of the Bible. 
 - Allowing registered user to `answer` the `question`.
 - Allowing registered user to `comment` `thumb up` and `thumb down` the `answer`

## Phase 2 (like stackoverflow)
 - Evaluating and scoring the `question` and the `answer` associated with each chapter/verse.
 - Showing recommended `question` and `answer` for the Bible verse/chapter for every user.
 - Recommending strategy could base on `score` and machine learning of user preference.
 - Evaluating and scoring each user. Defining `certified user` by certain criteria.

## Phase 3 (Chat room/social network/online study)
 - Allowing users that are viewing on a same a chapter or a verse of the Bible to have a real time discussion. 
- When a discussion is `hot`, invite `certified user` who have credibility on the topic to be involved in the discussion.
- Allowing `certified user` to organize online public small group study.

# Defense for the idea

- How the idea will improve growth?

Open discussion on God’s Word will help participants grow spiritually by thinking, interpreting and understanding God’s Word. Stand firm on God’s Word by sharing, encouraging comforting each other, improve the unity and harmony of the body of Christ. 

- What area of growth it will improve?

God’s Word, unity of the body of Christ.
Popularity and vitality of the community
  
- What do you think is estimated level of effort to implement this?

    Not sure about the effort, since never worked in a community. 
But every phase is doable and have a successful business model to follow.
As an engineer, implementing is never a time consuming task for me. Spike and POC is hardest.
This is my estimation for 4 engineers working full time:  
Phase 1  - 1 month
Phase 2  - 2 months
Phase 3  - 2 months
BTW, I didn’t put globalization and localization into consideration for this estimation. 

# Additional context
- Why reinvent the wheel? we already allowed people to share on social networks such as facebook and twitter.

    Key is Bible focused, At least I don’t know a place you can dedicatedly study, share, discuss Bible online.

- How we judge the question, answer and malicious users?

    We don’t judge. The Truth will reveal itself. 
Think about stackoverflow, for a popular question, a wrong answer will finally corrected by the community.
That also applies to any other discussion.  Zhihu is a Chinese platform like quora. (https://www.zhihu.com/question/28564647) You can see the drama of a credited user losing/earning his public credit depending on if he is respecting the truth not anything fake.

- Why do we need online Bible study?

    I don’t know, I feel it’s pretty in need and popular in China. Not sure about other countries.
